Spreadsheets for people who hate spreadsheets
I have always hated spreadsheets. I never used it if I could. Until, one boring day, I came across Miscell (https://github.com/owainkenwayucl/miscell)
It changed my whole perspective on the idea of spreadsheets. Will my dreams be accomplished? Found out on the next episode of NoExcell!
So, me, a progamming rookie who has just been doing text-based games that are not even complicated, supposed to do this? Answer: CSV. I was more motivated than ever before in my life of coding. I used to force myself. Now, when I have the time and energy, I code.
I ahted the fact that I had to load MisCell files to the Python app. So, I made a "fake-interactive" (i.e. PYTHON (Pretty much now You now enTer your old HomewOrk and eNjoy it) APP (Apparently Pretty DRY (get it?) implitation of the old lisP (Losts Of Silly Prarthenses) joke). So, if you wanan learn to code, so stuff that is useful and fun!

# How to Run This

    python maincsv.py
